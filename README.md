## Description

This project features a series of interactive particle systems developed with Three.js,to simulate dynamic visual effects inspired by physical phenomena. It utilizes advanced techniques to create engaging and responsive animations with a focus on realism and aesthetics.

### Ring Simulation 

A system that emulates the formation and dynamics of rings, inspired by planetary and astronomical structures.

### Meteors Toward a Black Hole

A simulation that recreates the movement of meteors drawn toward a black hole, highlighting gravitational influence and chaotic trajectories.

### Explosions

A system that represents dynamic explosions, capturing the dispersion and visual effects of released energy
